## My process

First I created a container with 100vh and 100vw, I used it to center the card in the middle of the screen, after that I styled the card, it was not necessary @mediaqueries because flexbox was used for styling, and one of the benefits is that it makes it good part of the design in responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS variables on :root
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this practical challenge I learned semantics in images, with the "alt" attribute and how to use :root to store colors and thus facilitate styling.

```html
<img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR-Code">
```
```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://origamid.com/projetos/flexbox-guia-completo/) - It helped me in Flexbox. This guide is good for remembering concepts and good usage practices.
